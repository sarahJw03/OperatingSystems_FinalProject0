# Operating Systems Final Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a simulation of a directed weighted graph using the C programming language and the raylib graphics library.

The project is divided into three milestones:

- Milestone 1: Read graph data from a file and compute the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- Milestone 2: Visualize the directed weighted graph using a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Milestone 3: Simulate movement of an entity along the shortest path with interactive controls.

## Features

### Milestone 1
- Reads graph data from an input file
- Validates input data
- Implements Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm
- Displays the shortest path and total cost

Example output:
```txt
0 -> 2 -> 5
12
```

### Milestone 2
- Displays graph nodes as circles
- Displays directed edges with arrows
- Displays edge weights
- GUI graph visualization

### Milestone 3
- Animated entity movement
- PLAY / STOP control button
- Movement based on edge weights
- 300ms movement steps
- 1 second waiting at intermediate nodes
- Arrival message at destination

...
start end
```

Example:
```txt

0 1 4
0 2 2
1 3 5
2 1 1
2 3 8
3 4 2
4 5 3
2 5 10
0 5
```
